# Project 15

Hi, My name is **Danesh Tolani** and I have completed the 15th Project of the iNeuron Full Stack Course.

The most challenging things were:

- Creating the cards and aligning them at proper position
- Managing the different backgrounds.

It took me **7 Hours** to complete this project
